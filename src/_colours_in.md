## colour specifics

FIXME All the forms are invisible, except when woven with coal threads or gold threads. Red threads are involved with combustion, their flame might be visible. Amber threads produced heat might heat air and the result waves might distort light, making the result of amber threads somehow discernable. Night threads absorb light, they look like darkness, they are thus visible (except in darkness).


### Amber

Boiling temperature. Some weavers may invest WPs to reach higher temperatures.


### Coal

### Quartz

By consuming 1 extra WP, all the threads (quartz and others) are revealed to other weavers. Non weavers must succeed a DD 8 WIS / Magic skill check to see. The GM may decide that some characters or creatures are thread blind and simply cannot see.


### Red

Fire, combustion. Weaver in dark ages England don't know what oxygen is, but they noticed that red threads didn't emit fire when cast in suffocating places. Some weavers call flame "blacksmith breath" (or "redsmith breath").
