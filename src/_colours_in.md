## colour specifics

FIXME All the forms are invisible, except when woven with black threads or white threads. Red threads are involved with combustion, their flame might be visible. Amber threads produced heat might heat air and the result waves might distort light, making the result of amber threads somehow discernable.

### Amber

Boiling temperature. Some weavers may invest WPs to reach higher temperatures.


### Red

Fire, combustion. Weaver in dark ages England don't know what oxygen is, but they noticed that red threads didn't emit fire when cast in suffocating places. Some weavers call flame "blacksmith breath" (or "redsmith breath").
