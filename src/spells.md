Halo or aureola of light.

A crown of light, some casters use it to light their tables at night.

* **Range** T touch
* **Diameter** -
* **Duration** 1 rnd
* **Prolong** 1 CP/rnd

Flashing hand.

The caster weaves golden light threads in his hand.

Creatures in front of the hand are blinded (unless they looked the other way or had their eyes closed). Blinded creatures have -2 to their AC and -2 to their hit and skill rolls while blind. As an On Turn Action, they may shake off their blindness with a successful _Mental_ save roll.

Cannot prolong.


## Gold Pole

* **Casting Time** main action
* **Range** S 10ft/CP
* **Diameter** -
* **Duration** 1 rnd
* **Prolong** 1 CP/rnd

Caster scope.

2 feet taller than its caster, the pole gathers light at one tip transmitting it to the other tip. Can be used as a sort of periscope, to look unnoticed through straw or foliage. Remember the pole is invisible to most creatures.

A caster with `Cast` 1 or better may control the flow of light turning the pole into a microsope or a telescope.

The caster may consume 1 CP to bend the pole, bow-like, but it won't turn into an endoscope.

Can be prolonged for free with a main action and a successful DC 6 skill check, same attribute modifier as used when weaving.


## Gold Shield

* **Casting Time** main action
* **Range** T touch
* **Diameter** broad shield
* **Duration** 1 min/CP
* **Control** <= 10ft/lvl
* **Move** 1 CP/10ft
* **Prolong** 1 CP/min

Image alteration shield.

This shield is sometimes called the "past window". The image seen through it is the same as the image that passed at the moment it was weaved. It can thus be used for some invisibility trick. The problem is that it works both ways, the other side looks like what it was at weaving time and vice versa. You can move behind the shield, but looking through it won't tell you much about the current situation there.

The caster may decide to simply use it as a mirror. All the the light going through it is reflected. Both sides.

For one extra CP, the shield can be used as a spotlight, a light emitting shield suspended mid air.


## Night Ball

* **Casting Time** main action
* **Range** M 30ft/CP
* **Diameter** 1ft/CP
* **Duration** 1 rnd/CP
* **Speed** 30ft/CP
* **Control** <= 10ft/lvl
* **Move** 1 CP/5ft
* **Prolong** 1 CP/rnd

A ball of light absorbing threads.

Can be thrown at a creature to blind it (provided it has eyes, uses them, and they fit in the radius of the ball). The referre may require a DC 6 `DEX` / `Shoot` skill check to "place" the ball at the right place.

More static uses of the ball are common, to simply prevent light/vision from crossing the ball radius.


## Night Disk

* **Casting Time** main action
* **Range** S 10ft/CP
* **Diameter** 5ft/CP
* **Duration** 10 min/CP
* **Control** <= 10ft/lvl
* **Move** 1 CP/5ft
* **Prolong** 1 CP/min

A disk of darkness hiding what is below or behind it.

Some people weave it in dark places to hide traps and trenches. Some casters place its threads over nothing, just to scare already scared foes.

It just looks like a pool of darkness.


## Night Hut

* **Casting Time** 1 main action, then 1 on turn action
* **Range** C 5ft/CP
* **Diameter** 5ft/CP
* **Duration** 1 min/CP
* **Control** <= 10ft/lvl
* **Move** 1 CP/5ft
* **Prolong** 1 CP/min

Chamber of obscurity, no light comes in or out.

Loose night threads woven in the form of a hut absorb light. Anything goes though except light.

* **Range** M 30ft/CP
* **Diameter** 1ft/CP
* **Duration** 1 rnd/CP
* **Speed** 30ft/CP
* **Control** <= 10ft/lvl

* **Prolong** 1 CP/rnd

Magic revealing floating ball.

A reveal ball, within its radius, a thread outlines threads left by other casters. The colours of those threads is revealed. Only the threads within the radius of the ball are outlined by the quartz thread.

By consuming 1 extra CP, all the threads (quartz and others) are revealed to other casters. Non casters must succeed a DC 8 `WIS` / `Cast` skill check to see. The referee may decide that some characters or creatures are thread blind and simply cannot see.

The ball might be quite smaller than the form of the thread it reveals. Blind man and elephant situation.


## Quartz Flail

* **Casting Time** main action
* **Range** S 10ft/CP
* **Diameter** -
* **Duration** 1 rnd
* **Speed** 80ft/CP

Thread breaking thread flail.

Should the flail threads collide with any other thread weave, the flail might unweave the target. The successful spellcasting score + the CP against an `INT` / `Cast` skill roll for the original caster (referee, please use 13 by default).

The flail only collides once.

An unlucky caster might flail uselessly at nothing, wasting CPs.


## Quartz Pole

* **Casting Time** main action
* **Range** S 10ft/CP
* **Diameter** -
* **Duration** 1 rnd
* **Prolong** 1 CP/rnd

Thread probing pole.

The pole is woven in the caster's hands, it can be used to probe for threads. It feels like holding a bamboo pole.

By consuming 1 extra CP, all the threads (quartz and others) are revealed to other casters. Non casters must succeed a DC 8 `WIS` / `Cast` skill check to see. The referee may decide that some characters or creatures are thread blind and simply cannot see.

* **Range** L 80ft/CP
* **Diameter** -
* **Duration** 1 rnd/CP
* **Speed** 80ft/CP

Hit point draining arrows, can be harvested if recovered.

The scarlet thread arrow fires from the caster's hand, it goes through its target and drains (1d8 + _élan_) HPs from it. The arrow flies then for damage * 10 feet and drops on the floor. It will dissolve after damage * 2 rounds.

Should the arrow fall into water, it dissolves twice faster.

Remember only the caster sees their own thread, but should a caster pick up the arrow, it may absorb the collected CPs if it succeeds a DC 6 `Cast` skill check, the attribute modifier is the same attribute modifier used by the caster of the arrow. If the skill check fails, the CPs are lost, if the skill check fails with a double 1, the caster incurs 1 HP damage.


## Scarlet Disk

* **Range** S 10ft/CP
* **Diameter** 5ft/CP

A creature walking on the disk will lose (1d6 + _élan_) HP (min 1). Half of these, rounded up, will be received as CPs by the caster of the disk if he is within 50ft of the disk. By consuming 1 more CP when casting, the range can be elongated to 100ft.

Creatures victim of the disk understand the magic nature of their loss if they succeed a DC 10 `WIS` / `Cast` skill check (remember -1 if they have no level in `Cast`).
