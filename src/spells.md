Remember only the caster sees their own thread, but should a weaver pick up the arrow, it may absorb the collected WPs if it succeeds a difficulty 6 Magic skill check, the attribute modifier is the same attribute modifier used by the caster of the arrow.

Image alteration shield.

This shield is sometimes called the "past window". The image seen through it is the same as the image that passed at the moment it was weaved. It can thus be used for some invisibility trick. The problem is that it works both ways, the other side looks like what it was at weaving time and vice versa. You can move behind the shield, but looking through it won't tell you much about the current situation there.

The weaver may decide to simply use it as a mirror. All the the light going through it is reflected. Both sides.

For one extra WP, the shield can be used as a spotlight, a light emitting shield suspended mid air.
