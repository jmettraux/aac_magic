## Amber Arrow

Fires a heat arrow at a single target.

1d3 + Magic skill level damage unless the target succeeds at a Physical save.

Can be used to put a easily flammable object in fire.


## Amber Ball

Some people are not very good at boiling water, it seems they never did it. Maybe their servant does it for them, maybe they are weavers and they use the Amber Ball to boil water.


## Amber Shield

The heat lens. Creatures attempting to cross the shield take 1d6 damage + weaver skill level.

Hot air waves distort light, so the shield is somehow discernable.

Missiles and polearm ends are not stopped by the shield.


## Black Arrow

Fires an arrow of weaving pain at a single target.

| WP | damage      |
|----|-------------|
|  1 | 1d4 + skill |
|  2 | 1d6 + skill |
| >3 | 1d8 + skill |

Skill is the Magic skill level.


## Black Shield

A shield of pain with (1d6 + skill) * WP "hit points". A creature attempting to cross the shield takes 1d6 damage. Those points are removed from the shield hit points. When the shield reaches zero points, it vanishes.

As a main action, the weaver of the black shield, may consume WPs to "mend" the shield, again (1d6 + skill) * WP.


## Blue Disk

Weaves cold threads into a disk that lays on the floor. In a dry place, the disk is invisible, in a humid place, ice forms and is visible.

Depending on the context, a creature might slide on the disk and fall. A wet hairy creature might get stuck to the disk, especially if the surface below the disk has some relief.


## Blue Finger

Threads generating cold are woven around the index finger of the weaver. The weaver is not affected negatively by the cold.

The threads can deal WP + skill cold damage. The GM can give an Evasion save to the victim if appropriate.

The finger can also be used to stop ongoing heat/burning damage.

(Beware touching metal objects!)


## Night Ball

A ball of light absorbing threads.

Can be thrown at a creature to blind it (provided it has eyes, uses them, and they fit in the radius of the ball). If the weaving succeeds, the weaver has to succeed a DC 6 DEX/Shoot skill check to "place" the ball.

More static uses of the ball are common, to simply prevent light/vision from crossing the ball radius.


## Quartz Ball

A reveal ball, within its radius, a thread outlines threads left by other casters. The colours of those threads is revealed. Only the threads within the radius of the ball are outlined by the quartz thread.

By consuming 1 extra WP, all the threads (quartz and others) are revealed to other weavers. Non weavers must succeed a DD 8 WIS / Magic skill check to see. The GM may decide that some characters or creatures are thread blind and simply cannot see.

The ball might be quite smaller than the form of the thread it reveals. Blind man and elephant situation.


## Quartz Pole

The pole is woven in the caster's hands, it can be used to probe for threads. It feels like holding a bamboo pole.

By consuming 1 extra WP, all the threads (quartz and others) are revealed to other weavers. Non weavers must succeed a DD 8 WIS / Magic skill check to see. The GM may decide that some characters or creatures are thread blind and simply cannot see.


## Red Disk

Disk of fire.

When the spell ends and its fire hasn't propagated to some flammable elements, the fire ends.


## Red Finger

Also known as the weaver lighter.

Read threads emit a flame at the point of the weaver's finger.

Once the weavery stops, the threads dissolve, the heat disperses.


## Scarlet Arrow

The scarlet thread arrow fires from the weaver's hand, it goes through its target and takes 1d8 + skill HPs from it. The arrow flies then for damage * 10 feet and drops on the floor. It will dissolve after damage * 2 rounds.

Should the arrow fall into water, it dissolves twice faster.

Remember only the caster sees their own thread, but should a weaver pick up the arrow, it may absorb the collected WPs if it succeeds a difficulty 6 Magic skill check, the attribute modifier is the same attribute modifier used by the caster of the arrow. If the skill check fails, the WPs are lost, if the skill check fails with a double 1, the weaver incurs 1 HP damage.


## Scarlet Finger

The weaver drops the tip of their finger on a victim's skin or fur and drains (1 + skill + attribute modifier) HPs. Those HPs are turned into WPs for the weaver. The attribute modifier is the one for the attribute used for casting (INT, WIS, or CHA).

The GM grants a saving throw to the victim or not.


## Scarlet Hand

The weaver lays their hand on the wound of a living target and weave threads that drain the the wounded of some of their hit points.

The target suffers 1d6 + skill damage which are turned to WPs and added to the weaver's current WP count.

(Remember that weaving requires at least 1 WP, so the in the worst case, the weaver might gain 1 - 1 WPs and the target might lose 1 HP).


## Silver Ball

The weaver throws a ball that pushes anything in its way. Direct damage is not dealt, but shields and spears are pushed aside and the ball does not yield.

Getting stuck between a silver ball and a thick wall might hurt.

Remember, may not be prolonged if out of prolongation reach.


## Silver Hand

The hand of the weaver leaves a trace of fence thread mid-air. It blocks anything except for threads.

As an instant action, the weaver can invest 1 WP to let the silver hand last one more round. The range for this "investment" is 30 feet.

Can be used as a "weaver duck tape".


## Silver Hut

Weaves a thread fence into a hut shape.

The hut has (1d8 + weaver magic skill) * WP hit points. As long as the hut has HPs it protectes completely its content.

By paying 1 WP (and an instant action), the weaver adds (1d8 + weaver magic skill) HPs to the hut.


## Turquoise Arrow

* **Casting Time:** main action
* **Range:** long (80 feet per WP)
* **Diameter:** -
* **Duration:** 1 rnd per WP
* **Speed:** 80 ft per WP

Works from 15 feet on only. Gives 1d3 + skill HP to the target. Does not stabilize a Mortally Wounded creature.


## Turquoise Hut

Mortally wounded creatures in the hut stabilize (as per rules, they reach 1 HP after 10 minutes of rest).


## Turquoise Pole

All the creatures touched by the pole gain 1d3 + skill HPs.

The pole does stabilize a Mortally Wounded creature.


## White Hand

The weaver shows their hand and the white thread they've just weaved flashes in their palm.

Creatures in front of the hand are blinded (unless they looked the other direction or had their eyes closed). Blinded creatures have -2 AC to their AC and -2 to their hit and skill rolls while blind. As an On Turn Action, they may shake off their blindness with a successful evasion roll.

Cannot prolong.


## White Pole

2 feet taller than its weaver, the pole gathers light at one tip transmitting it to the other tip.

Can be used as a sort of periscope, to look unnoticed through straw or foliage. Remember the pole is invisible to most creatures.

A weaver with Magic-1 or better may control the flow of light turning the pole into a microsope or a telescope.

The weaver may consume 1 WP to bend the pole, bow-like, but it won't turn into an endoscope.

Can be prolonged for free with a main action and a successful difficulty 6 skill check, same attribute modifier as used when weaving.


## White Shield

This shield is sometimes called the "past window". The image seen through it is the same as the image that passed at the moment it was weaved. It can thus be used for some invisibility trick. The problem is that it works both ways, the other side looks like what it was at weaving time and vice versa. You can move behind the shield, but looking through it won't tell you much about the current situation there.

The weaver may decide to simply use it as a mirror. All the the light going through it is reflected. Both sides.

For one extra WP, the shield can be used as a spotlight, a light emitting shield suspended mid air.
