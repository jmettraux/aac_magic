## Amber Arrow

Fires a heat arrow at a single target.

1d3 damage unless the target succeeds at a Physical save.

Can be used to put a easily flammable object in fire.


## Amber Ball

Some people are not very good at boiling water, it seems they never did it. Maybe their servant does it for them, maybe they are weavers and they use the Amber Ball to boil water.


## Black Arrow

Fires an arrow of weaving pain at a single target.

| WP | damage      |
|----|-------------|
|  1 | 1d4 + skill |
|  2 | 1d6 + skill |
| >3 | 1d8 + skill |

Skill is the Magic skill level.


## Black Shield

* **Casting Time:** main action
* **Range:** touch (touch)
* **Diameter:** broad shield
* **Duration:** 1 min per WP

A shield of pain with (1d6 + skill) * WP "hit points". A creature attempting to cross the shield takes 1d6 damage. Those points are removed from the shield hit points. When the shield reaches zero points, it vanishes.

As a main action, the weaver of the black shield, may consume WPs to "mend" the shield, again (1d6 + skill) * WP.


## Blue Disk

Weaves cold threads into a disk that lays on the floor. In a dry place, the disk is invisible, in a humid place, ice forms and is visible.

Depending on the context, a creature might slide on the disk and fall. A wet hairy creature might get stuck to the disk, especially if the surface below the disk has some relief.


## Night Ball

A ball of light absorbing threads.

Can be thrown at a creature to blind it (provided it has eyes, uses them, and they fit in the radius of the ball). If the weaving succeeds, the weaver has to succeed a DC 6 DEX/Shoot skill check to "place" the ball.

More static uses of the ball are common, to simply prevent light/vision from crossing the ball radius.


## Quartz Ball

A reveal ball, within its radius, a thread outlines threads left by other casters. The colours of those threads is revealed. Only the threads within the radius of the ball are outlined by the quartz thread.

By consuming 1 extra WP, all the threads (quartz and others) are revealed to other weavers. Non weavers must succeed a DD 8 WIS / Magic skill check to see. The GM may decide that some characters or creatures are thread blind and simply cannot see.

The ball might be quite smaller than the form of the thread it reveals. Blind man and elephant situation.


## Red Finger

Also known as the weaver lighter.

Read threads emit a flame at the point of the weaver's finger.

Once the weavery stops, the threads dissolve, the heat disperses.


## Scarlet Hand

The weaver lays their hand on the wound of a living target and weave threads that drain the the wounded of some of their hit points.

The target suffers 1d6 + skill damage which are turned to WPs and added to the weaver's current WP count.

(Remember that weaving requires at least 1 WP, so the in the worst case, the weaver might gain 1 - 1 WPs and the target might lose 1 HP).


## Silver Hut

Weaves a thread fence into a hut shape.

The hut has (1d8 + weaver magic skill) * WP hit points. As long as the hut has HPs it protectes completely its content.

By paying 1 WP (and an instant action), the weaver adds (1d8 + weaver magic skill) HPs to the hut.


## Turquoise Pole

All the creatures touched by the pole gain 1d3 + skill HPs.

The pole does stabilize a Mortally Wounded Creature.


## White Shield

* **Casting Time:** main action
* **Range:** touch (touch)
* **Diameter:** broad shield
* **Duration:** 1 min per WP

This shield is sometimes called the "past window". The image seen through it is the same as the image that passed at the moment it was weaved. It can thus be used for some invisibility trick. The problem is that it works both ways, the other side looks like what it was at weaving time and vice versa. You can move behind the shield, but looking through it won't tell you much about the current situation there.

The weaver may decide to simply use it as a mirror. All the the light going through it is reflected. Both sides.

For one extra WP, the shield can be used as a spotlight, a light emitting shield suspended mid air.
