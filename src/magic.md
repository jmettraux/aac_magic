Weaver casts spells by consuming Weave Points (hereafter WP or WPs).

After a good night rest, a Weaver disposes of their level plus their level times the best of their INT, WIS, or CHA modifier. Thus a level 2 Weaver with +2 in INT, disposes of 2 + 2 * 2 = 6 WP.

## casting cost in WPs

Casting a spell costs at least 1 WP. The Weaver decides how many WPs they use right before casting. The Weaver cannot go below zero WPs.

A weaver can, as an instant action, convert some of his HPs to WPs. The weaver must "spare" at least 1 HP.

Once the WP are consumed, a skill check against a difficulty of 8 has to be rolled 2d6 + Magic skill + attribute modifier.

The attribute modifier is either INT, WIS, or CHA, the Weaver decides which one to use, guided by the GM. In a given scene, the same modifier cannot be used twice in a row. For example, a Weaver cannot cast a spell with an INT modifier and then another (or the same spell) with an INT modifier, they must use the WIS or the CHA modifier.

The Weaver (or the GM) are invited to "roleplay" the spell depending on the att modifier used. INT cold logic, WIS street smart, CHA force of will.

## becoming frail to obtain WPs

A Weaver may accept become "frail" (see Injury) and immediately gain 1d6 WP plus the best of its INT, CHA, or WIS modifiers.

## casting at risk

A Weaver may accept a risk to reduce by one the WP cost of casting a spell. The minimal cost is still 1 WP. If the skill check results in a double 1, the cast fails, and 1d6 HPs have to paid by the caster or creatures within 5 feet. The GM determines who bears the extra cost and by how much. The caster must pay at least 1 HP or 1 WP, other designated targets must pay in HPs.

## known spells

A Weaver is usually granted 1 or 2 spells at level 1. As the Weaver gains experience, the GM considers their trail and hint at new spells. The GM may "loan" spells to the Weaver and eventually take them back. Two spells per level might be a good number for the known spells.
