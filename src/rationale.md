Weavers are person with the gift of weaving, weaving magical threads to achieve effects.

The gift doesn't seem hereditary. The majority of the weavers consider it a curse rather than a gift and hide it. A minority of people are weavers. Some weavers don't even know they have the gift, they might be gifted but blind, they don't see the threads although they trigger the weaving.

Some non-gifted people, through their friendship with weaver know of the gift. They keep the secret for fear of their friend to be discovered. Some non-weavers abuse weak weavers and use them but keep the silence.

Colours are known to many cultures. Balls, arrows, huts are known to many cultures. A simple vocabulary emerged around forms and colours, they easily translate from a language to the other. Weaver may thus easily describe what they are trying to achieve to each other.

Some travelled weavers say that in Constantinople, there are more colours and more forms and sophistication, but it's difficult to fathom.
